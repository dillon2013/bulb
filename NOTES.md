Candidate Name: Dillon Lee

Tasks: 1 and 3

Time: 
task 1: 2 hours
task 2: 1.5 hours


Notes:

In task one the first thing that was done was splitting the components out into smaller more testable units of code, this also made it more readable.

The App component controlled fetching the data and the application state.

Bits of styling was added using styled components but not enough time to come up with a decent design.

In task two I calculated the estimated end of month meter readings by using the previous and next month meter readings, getting the number of days between them and then using that to calculate the average usage per day. I then calculated the number of days left in the current month and multiplied that by the average usage per day. I then added this value to the current meter reading to get the estimate end of month reading.

To get the energy usage for the month I deducted the current month reading from the next month usage.
